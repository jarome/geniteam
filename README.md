A boilerplate for building web projects with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). Uses Gulp 4.x.

**Features**

- Concatenate, minify, and lint JavaScript.
- Compile, minify, autoprefix, and lint Sass.
- Optimize SVGs.
- Copy static files and folders into your `dist` directory.
- Automatically add headers and project details to JS and CSS files.
- Create polyfilled and non-polyfilled versions of JS files.
- Watch for file changes, and automatically recompile build and reload webpages.

**Gulp Boilerplate makes it easy to turn features on and off**, so you can reuse it for all of your projects without having to delete or modify tasks.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

*__Note:__ if you've previously installed Gulp globally, run `npm rm --global gulp` to remove it. [Details here.](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467)*

Make sure these are installed first.

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp Command Line Utility](http://gulpjs.com) `npm install --global gulp-cli`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	- `gulp` manually compiles files.
	- `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.

**Try it out.** After installing, run `gulp` to compile some test files into the `dist` directory. Or, run `gulp watch` and make some changes to see them recompile automatically.


### package.json

The `package.json` file holds all of the details about your project.

Some information is automatically pulled in from it and added to a header that's injected into the top of your JavaScript and CSS files.

```json
{
	"name": "project-name",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"description": "A description for your project.",
	"main": "./dist/your-main-js-file.js",
	"author": {
		"name": "YOUR NAME",
		"url": "http://link-to-your-website.com"
	},
	"license": "MIT",
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "http://link-to-your-git-repo.com"
	},
	"devDependencies": {}
}
```

*__Note:__ `devDependencies` are the dependencies Gulp uses. Don't change these or you'll break things.*

### Header

Gulp auto-injects a header into all of your JavaScript and CSS files with details from your `package.json` file.

Unminified versions get a fat header, while minified files get a one-liner. You can change what's included under the `banner` variable.

```js
/**
 * Template for banner to add to file headers
 */

var banner = {
	full:
		'/*!\n' +
		' * <%= package.name %> v<%= package.version %>\n' +
		' * <%= package.description %>\n' +
		' * (c) ' + new Date().getFullYear() + ' <%= package.author.name %>\n' +
		' * <%= package.license %> License\n' +
		' * <%= package.repository.url %>\n' +
		' */\n\n',
	min:
		'/*!' +
		' <%= package.name %> v<%= package.version %>' +
		' | (c) ' + new Date().getFullYear() + ' <%= package.author.name %>' +
		' | <%= package.license %> License' +
		' | <%= package.repository.url %>' +
		' */\n'
};
```
